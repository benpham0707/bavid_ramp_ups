a brief intro about yourself, your interests & hobbies, and what is a word people would use to describe you.
I'm currently in my last semester at Berkeley, I really enjoy being active by doing things like climbing, running, swimming, and hiking. 
Outside of being active I love music and playing games with my friends (both cards and video games). I'd say a word people would use to 
describe me is steadfast.
