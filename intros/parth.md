Hi my name is Parth! I am a freshman, I like to play tennis and am absolutely in love with sleeping and eating. I like to explore new hobbies and learn new thigns. I know a little bit of everything, chess, photography, cooking, magic, card games, etc. I am trying to pick a few things to really explore and excel in. But if you want talk about smtg or do an activity i would be down to do it/learn it with you. Can't wait to get started on this project, and get to know you better!
